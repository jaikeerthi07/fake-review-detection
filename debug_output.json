  "reviewDescription": "We have 4 animals so we\u2019ve bought a few at different times. The oldest one is about 2 years old and still works perfectly fine. You can ding the collar to find it if it comes off or find you animal when they hide. Our cats like to pretend they are jungle cats so sometimes we can\u2019t see them in taller bushes or they\u2019ve lost their collars and we\u2019ve had to retrieve them, this is very convenient and useful. Easy to set up, light, value for the money, easy to connect and monitor.",
